We show that if one (or both) of the site energies is assigned at random to pairs of lattice sites (that is, two sites in succession), an initially localized particle can become delocalized. Its mean-square displacement at long times is shown to grow in time as \\( {t}^{3/2} \\) provided that \\( - {2V} \u003c {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \u003c {2V} \\) . Diffusion occurs if \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} =  \\pm  {2V} \\) and localization otherwise.

In this paper, we consider probably the simplest tight-binding model that exhibits Anderson localization. We focus on a one-dimensional tight-binding model of a random binary alloy in which the site energies \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) and \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) are assigned at random to the lattice sites with probability \\( q \\) and \\( 1 - q \\) , respectively. A constant nearest-neighbor matrix element \\( V \\) mediates transport between the lattice sites. In one dimension,it is well accepted that for all nonzero \\( q \\) , all the eigenstates will be exponentially localized and no long-range transport will be observed at long times. \\( {}^{3} \\)\n\nConsider, for the moment, a particular realization of the site energies in a certain segment of the infinite lattice: \\( \\ldots {\\epsilon }_{a}{\\epsilon }_{a}{\\epsilon }_{b}{\\epsilon }_{a}{\\epsilon }_{a}{\\epsilon }_{a}{\\epsilon }_{b}{\\epsilon }_{b}{\\epsilon }_{a}{\\epsilon }_{b}{\\epsilon }_{b}{\\epsilon }_{b}{\\epsilon }_{b}{\\epsilon }_{a}\\ldots \\) Given the rigorous nature of the theorems establishing quasiparticle localization in one-dimension, it seems safe to assume that the one-dimensional results are not only independent of \\( q \\) ,but also of the number of \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) â€™s or \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) â€™s that appear in clusters in the lattice. That is, the localization of one-dimensional quasiparticles still persists if all clusters containing an odd number of \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) â€™s are replaced by clusters containing an odd number of \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) â€™s,for example. After all, under such a transformation, the system is still random and the localization theorems guarantee an absence of transport for any degree of randomness in one dimension. We show here that this is not the case. In particular, we show that when one of the site energies is assigned at random to pairs of lattice sites (that is, two sites in succession), \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) of the electronic states are extended over the entire sample. In addition, we show that the tight-binding model that describes this system is equivalent to a simplified version of the correlated disorder model recently proposed by Dunlap, Kundu, and Phillips (DKP). \\( {}^{4} \\) We refer to a lattice in which at least one of the site energies is assigned at random to pairs of lattice sites as the random-dimer model. We show by numerical simulation that the mean-square displacement of an initially localized particle in the random-dimer model will grow as \\( {t}^{3/2} \\) provided that \\( - {2V} \u003c {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) \\( \u003c {2V} \\) . Diffusion is shown to occur when \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} =  \\pm  {2V} \\) . In all other cases, the particle remains localized at long times. Our results are shown to be valid even when both \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) and \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) are individually assigned at random to pairs of lattice sites. This case is certainly more surprising than the former because it seems reasonable to assume that such a system is equivalent to the completely random binary alloy with two sites per unit cell. Here again, we show that this is not the case. We close by showing how an absence of localization can occur in a random two impurity model even when the pairing constraint is relaxed. The connection between such a model and transport in Fibonacci lattices \\( {}^{5} \\) is discussed. This work certainly suggests that a number of physically relevant models might exist that exhibit an absence of localization.\n\nTo determine the dynamics of an electron in the random-dimer model (RDM), we numerically integrated the equations of motion,\n\n\\[i{\\dot{c}}_{n} = {\\epsilon }_{n}{C}_{n} + V\\left( {{C}_{n + 1} + {C}_{n - 1}}\\right) , \\tag{1}\\]\n\nfor the site amplitudes \\( {C}_{n}\\left( t\\right) \\) and calculated the mean-square displacement,\n\n\\[\\overline{{m}^{2}} = \\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{m}{m}^{2}{\\left| {C}_{m}\\right| }^{2}. \\tag{2}\\]\n\nOur calculations were performed on a self-expanding chain with the localized initial condition \\( {C}_{0}\\left( {t = 0}\\right)  = 1 \\) . The self-expanding chain was used to minimize end effects; whenever the probability of finding the particle at the ends of the chain exceeded \\( {10}^{-{30}} \\) ,ten new sites were added to each end. The results from several random samples are shown in Fig. 1. The site energies were chosen from the bivalued distribution \\( {\\epsilon }_{n} = {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) and \\( {\\epsilon }_{n} = {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) with \\( q = \\frac{1}{2} \\) . This choice of \\( q \\) corresponds to the most disordered case. Figure 1 compares the mean-square displacement in the random-dimer model for three different values of \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) : (a) \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} = V \\) ,(b) \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) \\( = {2V} \\) ,and (c) \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} = {3V} \\) . The dotted curves are the data from single numerical simulations, whereas least-squares fits of the data with an expression of the form \\( \\overline{{m}^{2}} = A{\\left( Vt\\right) }^{b} \\) are represented by solid lines. The constant \\( A \\) was allowed to vary,while the exponent \\( b \\) was set to \\( \\frac{3}{2},1 \\) ,and 0 for the cases (a),(b),and (c),respectively. The subsequent straight-line fit through the data in each of these cases indicates that the transport properties are as advertised, namely, superdiffusive for \\( - {2V} \u003c {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \u003c {2V} \\) ,diffusive for \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} =  \\pm  {2V} \\) ,and localized otherwise. We emphasize that we have considered the most disordered case, \\( q = \\frac{1}{2} \\) . Hence,the results reported here could only be enhanced as the disorder is decreased."},{"url":"https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019650d9-5e6c-7124-8f39-566d7ee1b45d_1.jpg","page_idx":1,"page_width":1802,"page_height":2332,"md":"\n\n\u003c!-- Media --\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019650d9-5e6c-7124-8f39-566d7ee1b45d_1.jpg?x=123\u0026y=210\u0026w=755\u0026h=678\u0026r=0\"/\u003e\n\nFIG. 1.

Let us place the dimer on sites 0 and 1 . We assign the energy \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) to all the sites except sites 0 and 1 . Let the energy of sites 0 and 1 be \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) . A constant nearest-neighbor matrix element \\( V \\) mediates transport between the sites. We first show that \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) of the electronic states are unscattered by the dimer impurity. Then, we construct explicitly the unscattered states in a lattice containing randomly placed dimers. To proceed we calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients through the dimer impurity. Let us write the site amplitudes as \\( {C}_{n} = {e}^{ikn} + R{e}^{-{ikn}} \\) for \\( n \\leq   - 1 \\) and \\( {C}_{n} = T{e}^{ikn} \\) for \\( n \\geq  1 \\) ,where \\( R \\) and \\( T \\) are the reflection and transmission amplitudes, respectively. From the eigenvalue equation for sites -1 and 1,it follows that \\( {C}_{0} \\) \\( = 1 + R = T\\left( {{\\epsilon }_{ - }{e}^{-{ik}} + V}\\right) /V \\) with \\( {\\epsilon }_{ - } = {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) . Substitution of this result into the eigenvalue equation for site 0\n\nresults in the following closed expression:\n\n\\[{\\left| R\\right| }^{2} = \\frac{{\\epsilon }_{ - }^{2}{\\left( {\\epsilon }_{ - } + 2V\\cos k\\right) }^{2}}{{\\epsilon }_{ - }^{2}{\\left( {\\epsilon }_{ - } + 2V\\cos k\\right) }^{2} + 4{V}^{4}{\\sin }^{2}k} \\tag{3}\\]\n\nfor the reflection probability. The reflection coefficient vanishes then when \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} =  - {2V}\\cos k \\) or equivalently when \\( - {2V} \\leq  {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\leq  {2V} \\) . We point out that when this condition holds,or equivalently when \\( E\\left( k\\right)  = {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) ,the product of a pair of \\( b \\) transfer matrices yields the unit matrix. Under such conditions, Furstenberg's theorem implies that the electronic state at that energy will be extended. \\( {}^{6} \\) The location in the parent-ordered band of the perfectly transmitted electronic state corresponds to the wave vector \\( {k}_{0} = {\\cos }^{-1}\\left\\lbrack  {\\left( {{\\epsilon }_{b} - {\\epsilon }_{a}}\\right) /{2V}}\\right\\rbrack \\) . Of course,no transport would occur if only a single electronic state remained unscattered. To determine the total number of states that behave in this fashion,we expand \\( R \\) around \\( {k}_{0} \\) . To lowest order we find that in the vicinity of \\( {k}_{0} \\) , \\( {\\left| R\\right| }^{2} \\sim  {\\left( \\Delta k\\right) }^{2} \\) where \\( {\\Delta k} = k - {k}_{0} \\) . Consider now a crystal containing a certain fraction of randomly placed dimer impurities. Electronic states in the vicinity of \\( {k}_{0} \\) will be reflected with a probability proportional to \\( {\\left( \\Delta k\\right) }^{2} \\) . The time between scattering events \\( \\tau \\) is inversely proportional to the reflection probability. \\( {}^{7} \\) As a result,in the random system,the mean free path \\( \\lambda  = \\langle v\\rangle \\tau  \\sim  1/{\\left( \\Delta k\\right) }^{2} \\) in the vicinity of \\( {k}_{0} \\) ,where \\( v \\) is the velocity. \\( {}^{7} \\) Let \\( {\\Delta k} \\) \\( = {\\Delta N}/{2\\pi N} \\) . Upon equating the mean free path to the length of the system(N),we find that the total number \\( \\left( {\\Delta N}\\right) \\) of states whose mean free path is equal to the system size scales as \\( {\\Delta N} = \\sqrt{N} \\) . Because the mean free path is approximately equal to the localization length in one dimension, we find that the total number of states whose localization lengths diverge is \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) . Consequently, in the random-dimer model \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) of the electronic states remain extended over the total length of the sample. Such states move through the crystal ballistically with a constant group velocity \\( \\left\\lbrack  {v\\left( k\\right) }\\right\\rbrack \\) except when they are located at the bottom or the top of the band where the velocity vanishes. Because all the other electronic states are localized, the diffusion constant is determined simply by integrating \\( v\\left( k\\right) \\lambda \\left( k\\right) \\) over the width of \\( k \\) states that participate in the transport. The upper limit of the integration is then proportional to the total fraction of unscattered states or \\( 1/\\sqrt{N} \\) and \\( \\lambda \\left( k\\right)  \\sim  N \\) . In the case when the velocity is a nonzero constant, we obtain that \\( D \\sim  \\sqrt{N} \\) . Because the states which contribute to transport traverse the length of the system with a constant velocity, \\( t \\) and \\( N \\) can be interchanged or \\( D \\sim  {t}^{1/2} \\) . Consequently,the mean-square displacement grows as \\( {t}^{3/2} \\) . At the bottom or the top of the band where the group velocity vanishes, \\( v\\left( k\\right)  \\sim  k \\) and \\( D \\sim  1 \\) .\n\nWe now construct explicitly the unscattered states. In absence of any dimer impurities, the eigenstates are simply Bloch states of the form \\( {e}^{ikn} \\) . When the dimer impurities are present because the eigenstates in the vicinity of \\( {k}_{0} \\) have unit transmission,it must be the case that these states are still of the Bloch form. These states can be constructed as follows: Consider the single-dimer impurity case discussed earlier. The dimer impurity is located on sites 0 and 1 . The unscattered state must be of the form \\( {e}^{ikn} \\) for \\( n \\leq  0 \\) and \\( {e}^{{ikn} + {i\\Omega }} \\) for \\( n \\geq  1 \\) . That is, the only difference between the electron wave function before and after it has interacted with the impurity is that its phase changes by \\( \\Omega \\) . There is no reflected component. To determine \\( \\Omega \\) ,we consider the eigenvalue equation \\( E - {\\epsilon }_{b} = V\\left( {{e}^{{ik} + {i\\Omega }} + {e}^{-{ik}}}\\right) \\) for site 0 . This equation has a trivial solution when \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} = {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) or equivalently in the limit of an ordered system. In this case \\( \\Omega  = 0 \\) . The nontrivial solution occurs when \\( E - {\\epsilon }_{b} = 0 \\) . Recall that when \\( E - {\\epsilon }_{b} = 0 \\) ,the reflection coefficient vanishes and the product of two \\( b \\) -type transfer matrices yields the unit matrix. Because \\( E \\) is the energy of the ordered band, \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} + {2V}\\cos k \\) ,the vanishing of \\( E - {\\epsilon }_{b} = 0 \\) corresponds to the condition \\( - {2V} \\leq  {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\leq  {2V} \\) . In this case, \\( \\Omega  =  - {2k} + \\pi \\) . Consequently,the Bloch state that satisfies the SchrÃ¶dinger equation is \\( {e}^{ikn} \\) for \\( n \\leq  0 \\) and \\( - {e}^{{ik}\\left( {n - 2}\\right) } \\) for \\( n \\geq  1 \\) provided that \\( - {2V} \\leq  {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\leq  {2V} \\) . The wave function on the second atom of the dimer is the negative of the \\( a \\) -type atom located on site -1 . The unscattered state then is odd with respect to reflection around the first atom of the dimer. If another dimer were located on sites 2 and 3 , the corresponding perfectly transmitted wave would be \\( \\ldots {e}^{-{2ik}},{e}^{-{ik}},1, - {e}^{-{ik}} \\) , \\( - 1,{e}^{-{ik}},1,{e}^{ik},{e}^{2ik},\\ldots \\) provided,of course,that \\( - {2V} \\leq  {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\leq  {2V} \\) . Such states can always be constructed regardless of the number of dimer impurities that are placed at random in the lattice. Although the phase changes as the electron scatters from a dimer impurity,there is no reflection for \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) of the electronic states. It is straightforward to verify that similar states cannot be constructed for single impurities in the absence of off-diagonal disorder. We show in Fig. 2 a graph of the real part of a perfectly transmitted electronic state at a particular value of \\( k \\) as a function of the concentration of dimers. As is evident, the electronic state is extended although \"scattering\" occurs at each dimer. This is the principal result of this paper."},{"url":"https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019650d9-5e6c-7124-8f39-566d7ee1b45d_2.jpg","page_idx":2,"page_width":1802,"page_height":2332,"md":"\n\nThe only remaining question in the RDM is the exact location of the set of perfectly transmitted electronic states in the energy band of the disordered system.

In the context of structurally induced disorder, \\( {G}_{\\mu ;\\mathbf{n},\\mathbf{n}} \\pm  \\mu \\) was shown to be some function (linear or otherwise) of the relative displacement between ions located at \\( \\mathbf{n} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{n} \\pm  \\mathbf{\\mu } \\) . It was shown that if Eqs. (5) and (6) apply,an unscattered state will exist with wave vector \\( \\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{\\theta } \\) in the parent-ordered band. \\( {}^{4} \\) The total fraction of states in the vicinity of \\( \\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{\\theta } \\) that remains unscattered scales as \\( 1/\\sqrt{N} \\) . \\( {}^{4} \\) To apply this model to the problem at hand,we note that the site energies in the random-dimer model can be constructed from a constrained bivalued distribution of \\( G \\) â€™s- that is,from a distribution of the form \\( {G}_{n,n \\pm  1} = {G}_{a} \\) and \\( {G}_{n,n \\pm  1} = {G}_{b} \\) with probabilities \\( P \\) and \\( 1 - P \\) ,respectively. Because the site energies are of the form \\( {\\epsilon }_{n} = {G}_{n,n + 1} + {G}_{n,n - 1} \\) ,the constraint that must be imposed is that \\( {G}_{b} \\) ,for example,cannot occur consecutively in the lattice. The resultant site energies will be \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} = 2{G}_{a} \\) and \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} = {G}_{b} + {G}_{a} \\) with the \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) â€™s occurring in pairs. The matrix elements that are generated by \\( {G}_{a} \\) and \\( {G}_{b} \\) must,of course,be equal in the RDM. Solving the two simultaneous equations that result from Eq. (6) for the \\( \\cos \\theta \\) term,makes the matrix elements equal yields the general condition for the location of the unscattered state,\n\n\\[\\cos \\theta  = \\frac{1 - {3q}}{2{\\left\\lbrack  {\\left( V/W\\right) }^{2}{\\left( 1 + q\\right) }^{2} - 2q\\left( 1 - q\\right) \\right\\rbrack  }^{1/2}}, \\tag{7}\\]\n\nwhere \\( q \\) is the concentration of \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) . The location of the unscattered state is then a function of the concentration as well as the relative disorder \\( V/W \\) with \\( W = {\\epsilon }_{a} - {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) .

Consider a lattice containing two types of impurities with energies \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) and \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) with the constraint that the \\( b \\) -type impurities do not occur on neighboring lattice sites. Let \\( {V}_{a} \\) be the nearest-neighbor matrix element connecting two sites with energy \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) and \\( {V}_{b} \\) the overlap of two sites with energy \\( {\\epsilon }_{a} \\) and \\( {\\epsilon }_{b} \\) .

In such systems transmission resonances should be observed at particular energies when the criterion described above holds. In a forthcoming paper, \\( {}^{8} \\) we discuss in detail the relationship between such quasiperiodic systems and the single-impurity model.\n\nWe have presented some simple models which possess surprising localization-delocalization transitions. Transport in these models occurs because \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) of the electronic states are extended over the whole sample. Any physical system that can be described either by the RDM or the single-impurity model (such as Fibonacci lattices) should exhibit transmission resonances and a drastic enhancement in its conductivity when the Fermi level coincides with the position of the unscattered states. Hence, these models could be used to guide the synthesis of new highly conductive materials. As we have discussed earlier, \\( {}^{4} \\) the standard localization theorems \\( {}^{1 - 3} \\) are completely consistent with the occurrence of a set of delocalized states of zero measure. Such states do not affect the vanishing of the imaginary part of the self-energy along the \\( \\operatorname{Re}E \\) axis,for example. What is surprising here is that they are of sufficient number \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) to give rise to transport. Pendry \\( {}^{9} \\) has shown that in standard disordered models, isolated states at particular energies remain extended over \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) of the lattice sites. However, the number of states which behave in this fashion is exponentially small. \\( {}^{9} \\) As a result,such states do not affect the asymptotic value of the mean-square displacement of an initially localized particle, in contrast to the extended states in the RDM.
